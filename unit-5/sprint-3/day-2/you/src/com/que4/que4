A race-condition is a condition in which the critical section (a part of the program where shared memory is accessed)
is concurrently executed by two or more threads. It leads to incorrect behavior of a program.
In layman terms, a race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to
get certain shared resources.
