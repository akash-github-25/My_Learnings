1.One significant difference between the synchronized method and block is that 
Synchronized block generally reduces the scope of the lock.

2.synchronized blocks provide granular control over a lock, as you can use arbitrary
 any lock to provide mutual exclusion to critical section code. On the other hand, 
 the synchronized method always locks either on the current object represented
 by this keyword or class level lock, if it's a static synchronized method.
 
3.Synchronized block can throw java.lang.NullPointerException if expression 
 provided to block as parameter evaluates to null, 
 which is not the case with synchronized method.
