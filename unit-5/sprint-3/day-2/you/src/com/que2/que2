Object level locking:
Object level locking is mechanism when you want to synchronize a non-static method 
or non-static code block such that only one thread will be able to execute the 
code block on given instance of the class. This should always be done to make
 instance level data thread safe. 

 
 
Class level locking:
Class level locking prevents multiple threads to enter in synchronized block in any of 
all available instances on runtime. This means if in runtime there are 100 instances 
of DemoClass, then only one thread will be able to execute demoMethod() in any one of 
instance at a time, and all other instances will be locked for other threads. 
This should always be done to make static data thread safe.
