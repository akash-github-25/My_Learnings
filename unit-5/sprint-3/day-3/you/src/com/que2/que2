Callable interface
A callable interface throws the checked exception and returns the result.
 A runnable interface, on the other hand, shows the result or throws an exception,
  but does not do both.

Syntax
public interface Callable<T> 
{
  T call() throws exception ;
  }
  
  
  Runnable  interface
  It is required to create a thread when a runnable interface is implemented through an object.

The thread contains a single method named run() that does not return any value or accept any parameters.

Syntax
public interface Runnable 
{
  public abstract void run();
}
