Java does not verify unchecked exceptions at compile-time. Furthermore, we don't have to
 declare unchecked exceptions in a method with the throws keyword. And although the above
  code does not have any errors during compile-time, it will throw ArithmeticException 
  at runtime.
  
  Because the compiler can't anticipate logical errors that arise only at runtime,
   it can't check for these types of problems at compile time. That's why they are 
   called "unchecked" exceptions. Unchecked exceptions result from faulty logic that 
   can occur anywhere in a software program.
