HashMap is used to store data in the form of key value pairs where key and value 
can be of any datatype and it cannot store two same key as diffrent keys so if we try to
add two same key it will replace the other key.
Simlar for hashset , so in a hashset we cannot add two same values each and every data
should be diffrent.
LinkedList  is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous
 locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. 
 The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node.
