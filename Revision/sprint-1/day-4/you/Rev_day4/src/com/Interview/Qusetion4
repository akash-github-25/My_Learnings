1.With iterator you can move only forward, but with ListIterator you can move backword 
also while reading the elements.
2.With ListIterator you can obtain the index at any point while traversing, which is not 
possible with iterators.
3.With iterator you can check only for next element available or not, but in listiterator 
you can check previous and next elements.
4.With listiterator you can add new element at any point of time, while traversing. 
Not possible with iterator.
5.With listiterator you can modify an element while traversing, which is not possible with
 iterator.
