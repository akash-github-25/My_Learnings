What are the challenges of developing an Enterprise application?

1. Business requirements and environments keep changing
It is a dynamic business setting globally. Today, with several things on the move, changes
 and shifts are constant in the global business ecosystem. While a few may be technical 
 transformations, others may be in the form of economic disruptions. New workflows and 
 requirements keep coming up, making it hard for the developers.


2. Security is a major concern
Unlike other generic apps, enterprise app includes a lot of crucial business data.
 User access control and protection of the application’s resources is a challenge. 
 Enterprises need to be extra cautious about security and stay vigilant against hacking
  and other cyber attacks.


3. The shift toward the mobile platform
The global enterprise mobility market has been growing significantly. 
As mobility expedites information sharing and increases productivity, 
the inevitable shift toward mobile platform is another challenge faced by enterprise
 mobile app development companies.


4. Handling big data
Almost any global enterprise consists of a large volume of wealthy data. 
Effectively managing Big Data is a challenge. The colossal data involves data center
 costs, network costs, and storage costs. Moreover, it tends to slow down the response
  rate for the end-user. Locating and rationalizing the organization’s data properly while narrowing down the data sources is essential, but tough.
