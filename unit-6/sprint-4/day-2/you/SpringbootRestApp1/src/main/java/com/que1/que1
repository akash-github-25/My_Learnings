SERVLET-

A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of 
servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. 
Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the 
applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines 
HTTP-specific servlet classes.

DispatcherServlet handles an incoming HttpRequest, delegates the request, and processes that
request according to the configured HandlerAdapter interfaces that have been implemented
within the Spring application along with accompanying annotations specifying handlers, 
controller endpoints, and response objects.
