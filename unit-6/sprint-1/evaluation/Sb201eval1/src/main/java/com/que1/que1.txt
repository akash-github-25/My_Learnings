The advantages of Hibernate over JDBC are:

1. Hibernate code will work well for all databases, 
example :-  Oracle , MySQL etc.but JDBC is database specific.
2.The data can be placed in the cache for better
 performance in hibernate. Where as in JDBC the java cache is to be implemented.
 
3. No knowledge of SQL is needed because Hibernate is a set of objects and a table is 
treated as an object, where as to work with JDBC, one need to know SQL.

4. Query tuning is not required in Hibernate. 
  Where as in JDBC the query tuning is to be done by the database authors.
