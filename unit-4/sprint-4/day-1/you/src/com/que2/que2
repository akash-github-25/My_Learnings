Multiple inheritence is not possible in java at class level but we can have it at interface level.
for ex-let A and B be a class that overrides a method of class C if suppose there is another class D it is 
extending both class A and B now if it also has to use the same method then which class override method it is going to use,hence it 
will create ambiguity.
