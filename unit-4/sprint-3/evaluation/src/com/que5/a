interface A{
int i = 111;
}
class B implements A{
void methodB(){
i = 222;
}
}


Here we won't be able to update the value of i in the B class because once we define a variable in 
interface it is by default public final so we won't to be able to update it anywhere,we have to intialize it 
at the interface only.
