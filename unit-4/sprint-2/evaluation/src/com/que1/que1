a->Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.?

ans->String is immutable because once a String is created we cannot update it.

for ex-
String s="akash";
s.concat("mishra");
System.out.println(s);

 output=akash.
 
 what is the difference between String and String Builder?
 
 String-
 a.String created by string class is immutable.
 b.It requires more memory to create new instance.
 c.Slow as compared to string builder.
 
 String Builder-
 a.String created by this class is mutable.
 b.It requires less memory as it updates the existing instance.
 c.It is fast as compared to String.
 
 some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.
 
 1.int length();
 string str="akash";
 string.length-5;
 
 2.String concat(String args)
 String str="akash"
 String b=str.concat("mishra");
 b=akashmishra
 
 3.boolean equals(Oject args);
 String str="akash"
 str.equals("aka")-false;
 
 4.String substring(int i);
 String str="akash mishra"
 str.substring(0)-akash;
 
 5.Char charAt(int i);
 String str="akash mishra"
 str.charAt(0)-a
 
 
 
 b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.?

equals method-
   used for content comparision.
   it is a method of object class.
   it can be override.
   
 == method=
    used for reference comparision.
    it is an oprator.
    can't be overridden.
    
    
    code snippets and giving proper explanation
    
    
  String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));

true, here we are comparing the content



StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));

false, StringBuilde can't compare object.


String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1==s2);

false, it compares address and both have different address.
