Q1)  Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
        Explain with an example.?
        
 ans->
 WITHOUT NEW OPERATOR=>If we create string without new operator it will form only one object in RAM
 and it points to the content.
 
 WITH NEW OPERATOR=>If we create string with new operator it will form two object in RAM
 and it points to the address of the object.
 
 ex->
 String s1 = new String("akash");
		
		String s2 = "akash";
		String s3 = "akash";
		
		System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));-> true.
		System.out.println(s1 == s2);-> false.
